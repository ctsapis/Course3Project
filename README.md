Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

Merges 2 different sets (the training and the test sets) to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
